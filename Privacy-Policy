Welcome to My Pocket Muslim, a mobile application developed by MPM Global ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our app and its features, including signup, prayer tracker, Qibla direction, Halal restaurant locator, Surah, Dua, and Quran content.

By using My Pocket Muslim, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.

1. Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our services:

1.1 Personal Information
Email Address: Collected during signup to create and manage your account (optional for basic app use).
Password: Stored securely to authenticate your login (required only for account-based features).
Gender: Collected optionally to personalize your experience (e.g., prayer-related content or reminders).

1.2 Non-Personal Information
Usage Data: Information about how you interact with the app, such as prayer tracking habits, accessed Surahs, Duas, or Quran sections.
Device Information: Details like device type, operating system, and app version to optimize performance.

2. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:

Create and manage your account (email, password, gender) for account-based features like the prayer tracker.
Provide personalized features, such as prayer reminders and Qibla direction based on your location.
Suggest nearby Halal restaurants using your location data (if enabled).
Improve app performance and user experience through analytics.
Send you notifications (e.g., prayer times) if you opt in.
Ensure the security of your account and data.
Note: Signup and login are optional and only required for account-based features like the prayer tracker. Basic app content (e.g., Surah, Dua, Quran) is accessible without an account. We do not use your data for targeted advertising or sell it to third parties.

3. How We Share Your Information

Service Providers: With trusted third-party vendors (e.g., cloud storage or analytics providers) who assist us in operating the app, bound by confidentiality agreements.
Legal Requirements: If required by law, regulation, or legal process (e.g., a court order).
Safety and Security: To protect the rights, safety, or property of My Pocket Muslim, its users, or the public.
4. Data Storage and Security
Storage: Your data is stored securely on encrypted servers.
Retention: We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to provide the app’s services or as required by law. If you delete your account, we will remove your personal data within a reasonable timeframe, except where retention is legally required.
Security: We use industry-standard measures (e.g., encryption, secure authentication) to protect your data. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
5. Your Choices and Rights
You have control over your information:

Account Deletion: You can delete your account directly in the app via the settings menu, which will remove your personal data (subject to legal retention requirements).
Location Access: You can enable or disable location services in your device settings.
Notifications: You can opt in or out of prayer time notifications in the app.
Data Access: Contact us (see Section 9) to request access to or correction of your personal data.
If you are in a region like the EU or California, you may have additional rights (e.g., data portability, erasure). Contact us to exercise these rights.

6. Children’s Privacy
My Pocket Muslim is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that such data has been collected, we will delete it promptly. Please contact us if you believe a child under 13 has provided us with information.

7. Third-Party Services
The app may include links or integrations with third-party services (e.g., maps for Halal restaurants). These services have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices. Please review their policies before using those features.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the app or by email (if provided). The updated policy will take effect once posted, and your continued use of the app signifies acceptance of the changes.
